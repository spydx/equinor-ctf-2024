We started out with the intention of taking a nice calm morning walk, but destiny had other plans. As we walked out of the conference room and down to the lobby of the hotel, we noticed some familiar faces from team @10^-9 going the same way. 

"Where are you going?" we asked. 
"Nowhere" they said, and less than a second later both we and them are sprinting in the same direction like our lives depended on it.

## First location

Oslo trivia? Who better to ask than the one and only @Oslolosen? One peek at the picture and he knew the location: Munch Museum.

## Second location

The dots on the walls revealed the location as the opera house. Luckily it lies just across the bridge from the museum.

## Third location

Had no idea where this was, so we reached out to our good old friend once again

## Final location

Googled "byens beste kebab" and Dronningens kebab popped up. With the little that was left of our feet from all the sprinting, we halted our way there, and finally got our hands on the flag.

## Flag
We didnt check if it was solved prior to starting, so we thought we might have had a chance at first blood.

We were incorrect. But at least we got in a good workout.
